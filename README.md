## -Project Overview-

This project looks into the reasons why employees leave a company, using HR data and Microsoft Excel for analysis. The aim was to spot patterns and factors linked to attrition, and provide insights that could help reduce turnover.

I used Excel - pivot tables, charts, conditional formatting, power query, power pivot and basic statistical functions to explore relationships between variables like job role, satisfaction, work-life balance, and overtime.

## -Observation & Results-

### 1. Workforce Composition

The organization maintained a fairly balanced workforce with a slightly higher representation of male employees.

- _Total: 2,925 employees — 1,754 males, 1,171 females_
- _Active employees: 2,433_
- _Attrition: 492 or 17%_

### 2. Attrition Overview

Attrition affected a significant portion of the workforce, with a noticeable imbalance in both gender and performance levels.

- Gender Impact: More men left the organization than women, pointing to possible gender-specific retention issues. (312 male vs. 180 female attrition)
- Performance Impact: A large proportion of those who left were high performers, which could indicate issues with motivation, recognition, or career growth. (84% of attrition came from high performers – 413 employees)
- Departmental Trends: Attrition was particularly severe in the R&D department, followed by Sales. HR maintained relatively stable retention.
  - (R&D: 57% attrition | Sales: 38% | HR: 5%)

### 3. Job Satisfaction

While most employees feel positively about their work-life balance, a significant minority report poor experiences.

- A majority of employees experience a good or very good work-life balance. (Total positive responses: 320 employees)
- However, over 170 employees rated their work-life balance as poor or very poor, highlighting the need for better flexibility or workload management. (Poor: 123 | Very Poor: 49)

## Recommendation

- Retain High Performers: Implement reward programs, career growth plans, and targeted exit interviews to reduce high-performer attrition.
- Reduce Attrition in R&D & Sales: Assess workload and leadership in these departments; introduce retention strategies like flexible work and internal mobility.
- Address Gender-Based Attrition: Investigate male attrition trends and create tailored engagement initiatives for different employee groups.
- Boost Job Satisfaction: Run regular feedback surveys, improve manager training, and involve employees in decisions affecting their experience.
- Improve Work-Life Balance: Promote flexible work options, set boundaries for after-hours work, and expand wellness and mental health support.
